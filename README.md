1- i tried getting the event key or keycode but this behaviour was not so good in the android phones trying
2- second try i wanted to do a position absolute input which will be controlled by the labels via htmlFor for this there was some bugs that happens once a while but my friend @diamossab came with the idea of just using the onscreen keyboard like the wordle
3- starting to mimic the wordle keyboard is prettyeasy you have a long string drag your finger in all the keyboard you'll get this "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm" i did it again ðŸ˜‰ then either do the capitalization in css or select the string command+shift+p > Transform to uppercase the string will be changed upper case
